All tag mutators will be applied whenever any Bard field is output, you donâ€™t need to make any changes to your templates. However, only basic functionality is available with this method.

To use advanced features such as [metadata](mutators#metadata) and [data mutators](mutators#data-mutators) you need to use Bard Mutator's render method, either via the `bmu` tag or directly.

## Tag

To use the `bmu` tag update your template as follows:

```html
{{ bmu:my_content }}
```

Looping over sets is also supported:

```html
{{ bmu:my_content }}
    {{ if type == "text" }}
        {{ text }}
    {{ elseif type == "image" }}
        <img src="{{ src }}">
    {{ /if }}
{{ /bmu:my_content }}
```

## Direct

If you need to use Bard Mutator's render method outside of a template, for example when using the REST or GraphQL API's, you can call it directly:

```php
use JackSleight\StatamicBardMutator\Facades\Mutator;

$my_content = Mutator::render($entity->augmentedValue('my_content'));
```
